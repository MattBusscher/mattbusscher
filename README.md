### Hi there and Welcome to My Github Page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a generalized software developer, and this github represents a lot of projects that I have worked on or been a part of. Although many of my more serious works are covered in contract and cannot be shared to the public, feel free to look through my repositories to learn more about me or help yourself with a project. Raise issues in the repository if there is something you have a question or problem with, and I will do my best to get back to you in a timely manner. 

Although in my professional career I use javascript frequently to solve many business issues, my favorite languague is python. It is so good for a general purpose languauge and it is only improving with each release. And although the landscape is and always will be rapidly changing, I beleive that python will be used in some form. Even though python is my perfered language, I have touched many others in smaller capacity. I believe strongly that a large part of programming is choosing the right tool for the job, which sometimes means you have to venture out into other technologies that you may be less farmiliar with in order to effectively solve an issue. It is because of these challenges that I have also worked with PHP, Laravel, Typescript, and many more frameworks and packages within those languages.
